# CS310 - Ch03Exercise07

This repository contains my solution for Chapter 3, Exercise 7 of CS310. The program calculates the monthly interest on a credit card balance using the average daily balance formula. The program takes inputs for starting balance, payment, days in the billing cycle, days left after payment, and monthly interest rate, and outputs the interest amount to the console and a text file.

## CS310 - Ch04Exercise16

This repository contains my solution for Chapter 4, Exercise 16 of CS310. The program helps an author estimate potential royalties from a new romance novel based on three different publishing contract options. The program prompts the user to enter the net price of a single copy of the novel and an estimated number of copies that will be sold. It then calculates the royalties for each of the following contract options:

- Option 1: $5,000 upon manuscript delivery and $20,000 upon publication.
- Option 2: 12.5% of the net price per copy sold.
- Option 3: 10% of the net price for the first 4,000 copies, and 14% for any copies beyond that.

After calculating, the program outputs the royalties for all three options and clearly identifies which option yields the highest estimated earnings.
