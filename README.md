# CS310 - Ch03Exercise07

This repository contains my solution for Chapter 3, Exercise 7 of CS310. The program calculates the monthly interest on a credit card balance using the average daily balance formula. The program takes inputs for starting balance, payment, days in the billing cycle, days left after payment, and monthly interest rate, and outputs the interest amount to the console and a text file.

## Files

- `Ch03Exercise07.cpp` : The C++ source code for calculating monthly interest.
- `README.md` : This file.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ Ch03Exercise07.cpp -o Ch03Exercise07
